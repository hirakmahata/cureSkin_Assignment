19 WS
45 AS

## Problem 2:

const input = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

above is the input for the problem and you have to write a javascript program to convert it to

const output = [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { c: 3 }];

## problem 3:

const input [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { c: 3 }];

above is the input for the problem and you have to write a javascript program to convert it to
